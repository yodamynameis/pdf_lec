Scene: 1
Narration: Matrix multiplication combines two matrices, but only if they are compatible. The number of columns in the first matrix must equal the number of rows in the second. The resulting matrix gets its dimensions from the outer values: the rows of the first matrix and the columns of the second.
Visuals: *   Display two `Text` objects representing matrices A and B side-by-side. For A: `Text("Matrix A")` above `Text("[[*, *], [*, *], [*, *]]")`. For B: `Text("Matrix B")` above `Text("[[*, *, *], [*, *, *]]")`.
*   Show the dimensions below each matrix. Under A: `Text("3 rows, 2 columns")`. Under B: `Text("2 rows, 3 columns")`.
*   Draw a glowing `Rectangle` around "2 columns" under A and "2 rows" under B to show the inner dimensions. A `Text("Match!")` object appears between them.
*   Draw an `Arrow` from "3 rows" under A and an `Arrow` from "3 columns" under B, pointing to a new placeholder for the result matrix C, with the text `Text("Result: 3x3 matrix")` appearing.

Scene: 2
Narration: The core of matrix multiplication is the row-by-column operation. To calculate a single element in the result matrix, you take one row from the first matrix and one column from the second. You then multiply their corresponding elements and sum the products.
Visuals: *   Show Matrix A `Text("[[2, 1], [3, 4], [5, 6]]")` and Matrix B `Text("[[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]")` on screen.
*   Draw a `Rectangle` to highlight the first row of Matrix A: `[2, 1]`.
*   Draw a `Rectangle` to highlight the first column of Matrix B: `[7, 10]`.
*   Draw an `Arrow` connecting the `Text("2")` from A to the `Text("7")` from B. Simultaneously, an `Arrow` connects the `Text("1")` from A to the `Text("10")` from B.
*   The expression `Text("(2 * 7) + (1 * 10)")` appears at the bottom of the screen.

Scene: 3
Narration: Let's see that in action. To find the element in the first row and first column of our result, we use row one from A and column one from B. The calculation gives us our first value, which we place in the top-left corner of the new matrix.
Visuals: *   The highlighted row and column from the previous scene remain. The expression `Text("(2 * 7) + (1 * 10)")` is visible.
*   The expression simplifies on screen: `Text("14 + 10")`, which then becomes `Text("24")`.
*   A result matrix C appears, represented by a `Text` object with placeholders: `Text("[[?, ?, ?], [?, ?, ?], [?, ?, ?]]")`.
*   The `Text("24")` object moves and replaces the top-left placeholder '?' in matrix C. The final C looks like `Text("[[24, ?, ?], [?, ?, ?], [?, ?, ?]]")`.

Scene: 4
Narration: This process is repeated for every position in the result matrix. To find the element for row one, column two, we use row one from A and column two from B. We continue this pattern for all row and column combinations until the result is complete.
Visuals: *   The first row of A `[2, 1]` and second column of B `[8, 11]` are highlighted.
*   The calculation `Text("(2*8) + (1*11) = 27")` appears and the value `27` populates the next spot in C.
*   Quickly animate through the remaining calculations without detailed steps. The highlights move systematically across A's rows and B's columns, and the corresponding results `30`, `61`, `76`, `92`, `93`, `114`, and `135` fill in the rest of matrix C.
*   The final, fully populated matrix C is displayed: `Text("[[24, 27, 30], [61, 76, 92], [93, 114, 135]]")`.

Scene: 5
Narration: To summarize: first, always check that the inner dimensions match. Second, remember that each element in the output is the sum of products from one row of the first matrix and one column of the second. This powerful operation is a cornerstone of engineering and computer science.
Visuals: *   The full equation `A * B = C` is centered on screen.
*   A bullet point appears below: `Text("- Rule 1: Columns of A must equal Rows of B")`. The inner dimensions on the original matrices (2 and 2) briefly flash.
*   A second bullet point appears: `Text("- Rule 2: Result element is from one Row x one Column")`.
*   The third row of A `[5, 6]` and second column of B `[8, 11]` are highlighted, and then the corresponding result `114` in matrix C is highlighted to reinforce the concept one last time.
